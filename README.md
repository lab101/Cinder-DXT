# Cinder-DXT

Encoder and decoder for the DXT video format.
I created a Cinder block of the excelent code by https://github.com/roxlu written for one of my projects.


Advantages
- plays multiple video files at once.
- have a fast disk with a lot of space.
- need a encoder which is open.
- easy to use in a thread.

Isn't so interesting if you have a slow and small disk.


The cinder block works as most cinder blocks.
I've also included the code and scripts to encode to dxt format.
You will need to install cmake in order to build the encoder.
The encoder needs a folder with the video frames.
I used avconv for this (check the script folder).
